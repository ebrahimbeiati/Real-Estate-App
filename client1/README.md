- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that efficiently stores and handles real estate data.
- **Firebase Authentication**: A service that simplifies user authentication, allowing users to sign in with Google, Facebook, or Twitter accounts.

## React + Vite Setup

This project uses **Vite** as the build tool and **React** for the frontend. Here's how the React + Vite setup works:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to provide Fast Refresh functionality, offering an enhanced developer experience with fast live reloading.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for a more performant build process, especially for larger codebases.

You can choose between these plugins depending on your performance preferences and project requirements.
